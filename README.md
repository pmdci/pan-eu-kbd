# PMDCI Pan–European Keyboard Layout
This layout builds on And Dover's excellent Pan European Keyboard Layout ([doxdesk](https://www.doxdesk.com/)), with some crucial tweaks to better suit users accustomed to the US International layout.

## Background

I needed a keyboard layout that supports multiple European languages.

Dover’s layout is excellent, but all of its dead keys follow a _postfix_ model—type the letter first, then the modifier. I’ve been using the US International layout for years, which uses a _prefix_ model—modifier first, then letter.

Take the character `á` as an example:

- In Dover’s layout: `AltGr+a`, then `]` → `á`

- In US International: `AltGr+'`, then `a` → `á`    

The PMDCI Pan–European layout supports **both** methods.

On top of that, I’ve added extra combinations for advanced punctuation and diacritics.

## Who is this for?

If you’re used to the US International layout, you’ll feel right at home. This layout builds on its foundation, while extending it with advanced combinations inspired by Dover’s design.

The UK version stays faithful to the British ISO layout (including the position of the `"` and `@` symbols, and the extra key), while offering a comprehensive set of dead key combinations from both the US International and Dover’s layouts.
